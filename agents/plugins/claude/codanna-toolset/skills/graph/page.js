 * Mount the disc into one element.
 *
 *   mountVaultGraph(root, data, deps) -> the __vg debug surface
 *
 * root  the element to build inside. Must be the page's own root -- the element carrying
 *       class="vault-graph", since every rule in page.css is scoped under it and every
 *       custom property is declared on it.
 * data  what build-graph.mjs or the plugin's adapter produced.
 * deps  { Graph, Sigma, rendering, logoMask } -- INJECTED rather than read off `window`,
 *       because in a plugin the libraries are bundled module imports and never become
 *       globals at all. The standalone page passes its UMD globals in; see shell.html.
 *
 *       Also, optionally:
 *         folderColors      { "<folder>": "g7" } -- the saved per-folder palette slots.
 *         subfolderColors   { "<folder>/<sub>": "g7" } -- as folderColors, one level down.
 *                           Keyed to match subShade and subOrder's own keys -- "" for
 *                           notes sitting directly in the folder. Pins the whole tint the
 *                           automatic ladder would otherwise compute for that subfolder.
 *         onSubfolderColors(m) as onFolderColors, for that map.
 *         folderShown       { "<folder>": true|false } -- saved per-folder visibility
 *                           DEFAULTS. Tri-state: absent means "whatever the `_` rule
 *                           says", which is hidden for a folder whose name starts with an
 *                           underscore and shown for everything else.
 *         onFolderShown(m)  as onFolderColors, for that map.
 *         panEnabled        false to start with drag-to-pan off. ABSENT MEANS ON -- a fresh
 *                           page has no saved answer, and dragging is what a graph does, so
 *                           the default cannot be "wait to be told". The corner control
 *                           flips it live; this is only where it starts.
 *         onPanEnabled(v)   as onFolderColors, for that flag.
 *         pinned            note ids to put in the hub at mount, in slot order. Filtered
 *                           against the graph on the way in: the store outlives the vault
 *                           it was written from, so a note that has since been renamed or
 *                           deleted is simply not there any more and the hub opens without
 *                           it rather than holding a slot for a note that cannot be drawn.
 *         onPinned(ids)     as onFolderColors, for that list.
 *         settingsUI        true to show the gear AND let it open the page's own panel.
 *                           The STANDALONE sets this, because nothing else there can hold
 *                           a setting.
 *         openSettings()    show the gear but hand its click to the host. The PLUGIN sets
 *                           this: the gear belongs in the view either way -- it is where
 *                           somebody looking at the disc goes to look for it -- but what
 *                           it opens is Obsidian's own settings tab, not a second panel
 *                           saying the same things. Mutually exclusive with settingsUI;
 *                           if both arrive, this one wins.
 *         onFolderColors(m) called after a change, with the new map. THE HOST PERSISTS,
 *                           not this file: the plugin writes it through saveData() and
 *                           the standalone into localStorage, and page.js knowing about
 *                           either store would put an Obsidian-forbidden API (or a
 *                           useless one) into the other target's bundle.
 *
 * WAS AN IIFE. Nothing about the body changed when it stopped being one: it already kept
 * every name to itself, which is what made this a signature change rather than a rewrite.

   * Obsidian is arguably such a host: its tabs do not change visibilityState, only the app

   * THE RESTING WEB IS A BUDGET, and the share it buys shrinks as the vault grows.
   *
   * Sigma pays for every edge in the graph on every refresh, and hiding them does not help:
   * measured on the 10k fixture (36k links), a refresh costs 30.2ms as shipped, still 25.6ms
   * with the reducer short-circuiting every edge to hidden -- 36k reducer calls and sigma's
   * own per-edge iteration cost ~18ms even when nothing is drawn. Only absence is cheap. So a
   * vault past EDGE_RAMP_START draws only its strongest links at rest, chosen by weight, and
   * the rest exist only in the adjacency map -- until a hover or selection materialises the
   * focused note's complete web on top (see syncLazyEdges), which is what makes the omission
   * safe: every link is still reachable, it is just quiet until pointed at.
   *
   * The share ramps rather than switching: everything renders up to EDGE_RAMP_START, then the
   * share falls linearly to EDGE_FLOOR at EDGE_RAMP_END and holds there, so even a monster
   * keeps a skeleton of its strongest structure. Against the vaults this repo is tuned by:
   * the real vault (1,576 links) renders 100%; the demo vault (4,902) renders its strongest
   * 67% (~3.3k); the 10k fixture (37,373) renders 10% (~3.7k). Weight-descending selection
   * means what survives is the structure a reader would trace anyway -- at 36k the full web
   * reads as fog, and the fade-in of 36k links during a cascade is a wall of movement behind
   * the notes.

  // edge notes is the gap's arc -- 1 degree at r=1334 is 23 graph units against the
  // ~156 that two max-size dots need. Even 2 degrees only reaches 46.
  //
  // So notes are also held off the edges by an absolute ARC, converted to a
  // fraction of the cell's own reference width. Capped, because a narrow wedge
  // cannot afford much: without the cap a 16-note cell wanted 30% of its span at
  // each end, which squeezes its interior enough to trade edge collisions for
  // interior ones.
  // Tuned by sweeping, not derived -- because the pad trades three things off at
  // once (edge collisions, interior collisions, and how ragged the disc's outer edge
  // gets) and only measurement finds the corner. Swept at a fixed window:

  //
  // 70/0.22 was the first guess and it was wildly over-specified: it cleared the

  // failure mode, and added 480 units of raggedness. 35/0.10 clears them at the

  // at all (cells' last rows are partly filled, so their outer radii differ anyway).

  // note-to-note step ALONG a row: measured, the along-row spacing at the outermost row of
  // three vaults is 161, 178 and 165 against a 160 row pitch -- within 12% on vaults spanning
  // 22x the note count, which is what makes a single constant safe here.
  //
  // ONE SEAM FOR EVERY BOUNDARY, group and subfolder alike, and it is the SUB-wedge width --
  // the narrower of the two. There were two widths on the reasoning that a group boundary
  // matters more than a subfolder one and should read as wider; in practice the colours and
  // the legend already carry that distinction, and the wide version reads as a slice missing
  // from the disc rather than as a seam between neighbours.
  //
  // AND THE CHANNEL HAS PARALLEL EDGES. A constant ANGLE is a wedge: it buys arc in
  // proportion to radius, so the channel fanned open toward the rim -- four times the width
  // at the outer row that it had at the inner one, on a band four rows deep. Sizing it in
  // width and dividing by the radius each note actually sits at inverts that: the angle
  // shrinks as the radius grows, every row is separated by the same arc, and the locus of the
  // edge is a straight line offset half a seam from the radius rather than the radius itself.
  // (A point at radius r offset by angle w/2r sits at perpendicular distance r*sin(w/2r), which
  // is w/2 for any r -- so the two edges of a channel are genuinely parallel, not merely
  // closer to it.)
  //
  // Per BAND, because the two rings sit at different radii and one angle cannot be the same
  // width at both.
  //
  // The circularity the note-count proxy existed to dodge is real but avoidable: the radius
  // here is the LOCKED one, fixed once from the full-vault plan, so it is a constant by the
  // time any of this runs rather than something the current plan is still deriving. For the
  // single plan that produces the lock, the old degrees-and-note-count rule stands in.
  // AND IT FALLS OFF AS A BAND GETS DEEPER. A seam that is a fixed width reads as generous on
  // a five-row ring and as a canyon on a twenty-three-row one: the deeper the band, the more
  // wedges it carries and the more of them any one seam competes with, so the same channel
  // asks for more of the eye. Rows are the right measure of that -- they say how big the disc
  // is AND how dense, where a note count says neither on its own.
  //
  // The exponent is fitted, not derived, and the three points it was fitted to are worth
  // keeping: at 5 outer rows (a 454-note vault) half the base seam, at 9 rows (1402 notes) a
  // quarter, and at 23 rows (10,001 notes) none to speak of. (REF/rows)^1.5 gives 0.50, 0.21
  // and 0.05 against those -- 12, 5 and 1 graph units of seam, the last of which is a fifth of
  // a pixel on screen and is the "no gap" the biggest vault wants.
  //
  // This is the third thing to stand where gapScale's note-count ramp used to. It is the same
  // intent -- less seam as a vault grows -- against a quantity that actually describes the
  // geometry rather than standing in for it.
  // Raised from 0.075 once the margins stopped reserving a band-typical dot at every wedge
  // end (see the margin note in placeCell). With the notes' ink landing ON their boundary, the
  // seam IS the visible channel -- at 0.075 it was 12 units, so the two edges of every seam
  // sat on top of each other and read as one doubled line instead of as a gap. At 0.3 the

  //
  // Half a pitch per side with nothing added is the ZERO point: two wedges each holding their
  // end note half a step in from their own edge puts those two notes exactly one step apart,
  // which is a boundary you cannot see. Everything above that is the seam a person reads, so
  // that is the number to name and to scale.
  //
  // EXCESS_BASE is what the disc had (0.44 of a step) and the falloff takes it from there, so

  // which is what was asked for, rather than half of some term that turns out to contribute
  // little of it.
  //
  // Two earlier attempts moved the wrong number. Shrinking the SEAM took it from 24 units to
  // 12 and changed the measured channel from 1.60 to 1.60 -- the seam is a tenth of it. Adding
  // an excess ON TOP of the existing margin made it wider still (1.60 -> 1.90), because the
  // margin and the dot term were already the whole excess. Measured channels over an ordinary
  // step, before any of this: 1.60, 1.72, 1.52 on the three vaults -- so the excess to scale is

  // Two of them counted groups with an INTEGER, and the one that positions the wedges is
  // where the toggle jump lived for an entire afternoon -- fixing the other one first
  // changed nothing visible and looked like the fix had failed.
  //

  //
  //   subGaps   buildWedgePlan spends no sub-gaps. Its output is the reference width the
  //             row counts are solved against, not a rendered arc.
  //   clamp     only the rendered allocation can overflow the circle, because only it
  //             spends sub-gaps; it shrinks gap and subGap together rather than eating
  //             into the wedges.
  //   totFloor  the two callers floor the weight total differently (1e-4 vs 1e-6).
  //             Preserved exactly -- unifying it would move every wedge for no reason.
  //
  // PRESENCE IS "IS ANYTHING HERE", NOT "HOW FULL IS IT". A wedge earns one gap by
  // existing; a folder showing 30 of its 100 notes is one wedge and wants one gap, exactly
  // as it did at 100. So the gap total must not be a function of the note count -- and for
  // a long time it was, twice over.
  //
  // Weight over seats was the reading before, and it fails in both directions. Its own
  // note recorded the failure it was chosen to avoid -- weight ALONE keeps a 55-note folder
  // pinned at 1 all the way down to its last note and then collapses in two frames -- but
  // the denominator brought a worse one: seats are whatever the current plan happens to
  // seat, so the same group reads 0.3 mid-animation, 0.48 at rest with a range applied, and
  // 1.0 once the departed notes leave the plan. Measured: nG 7 -> 3.38 across settle() on a
  // date change, and 6.716 -> 7 merely from scrubbing the timeline.
  //
  // Both problems have one answer, and it is not a better formula here. The COLLAPSE case
  // is a group on its way out, and a group on its way out is something the cascade knows
  // about before the first frame -- so it supplies the presence itself, walked from 1 to 0
  // across the whole animation (opts.groupPres). What is left for this function is only
  // "does this group have anything at all", which min(1, weight) answers, ramps smoothly
  // over the first or last note's fade, and does not care how many notes there are.
  //
  // Seats are therefore not consulted at all any more, and the parameter is gone: every
  // reading of them was a way of dividing by a number that had nothing to do with the
  // question.
  //
  // ...EXCEPT WHEN THE PLANNER SUPPLIES IT (opts.groupPres). Weight over seats is the right
  // reading of "how present is this group" only while the seats are the group's own final
  // count. During a cascade they are not: the plan is rebuilt every frame from what is
  // still on screen, so a group that KEEPS 30 of its 100 notes reads 30/100 = 0.3 while
  // the departing 70 are still seated, and 1.0 the moment they leave the plan. Nothing
  // about that group's gap should have moved -- it is still there, still one wedge, still
  // entitled to one gap -- and the whole reservation moved twice instead.
  //
  // A legend toggle never showed it, which is why it survived: hiding a folder takes every
  // note in it to zero together, so presence runs 1 -> 0 cleanly and the survivors stay
  // pinned at 1. Only a filter that thins groups WITHOUT emptying them separates the two
  // readings, and the date range is the first such filter this page has had.
  //
  // So the cascade hands in a presence walked between the two packings by its own progress,
  // exactly as it already does for row counts -- one planner, one clock, and a group's gap
  // is about whether the group is there rather than how full it is.

    // THE DENSITY KNOB (github#13). SP is the lattice spacing -- radial between rows
    // AND tangential along them, which is what makes the packing uniform -- and it was
    // a hard 1. That made the disc a function of how many notes the VAULT holds rather
    // than how many are on screen: measured, screen row pitch was 19.481px at every
    // filter state of a 500-note vault and 12.064px at every state of a 1500-note one,
    // so filtering 503 notes down to 62 moved the median dot from 4.254px to 4.208px
    // and left 25% of the disc's radius as empty margin.
    //
    // Solve it instead. A lattice of spacing s holds 1/s^2 notes per unit area, so an
    // annulus with a hole at HOLE*R holds n = pi*R^2*(1-HOLE^2)/s^2, i.e.
    // R = s*sqrt(n / (pi*(1-HOLE^2))). Setting that equal to the FULL-vault R gives
    //
    //     s = sqrt(n_full / n_visible)

    // exactly -- not an approximation, the same uniform-density assumption the r0
    // formula below already makes. The disc then always fills its box, notes move
    // outward as their neighbours leave, and each one gets proportionally more room.
    //
    // CONTINUOUS, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT. The retired REPACK_BELOW mechanism below
    // switched plan basis at 55% and its three failures were all failures of the
    // THRESHOLD: inconsistent either side, two packings inside one animation, and call
    // sites disagreeing about which side they were on. A smooth function of the visible
    // weight has no side to be on. It also holds the two invariants for free -- a
    // departing note sits at weight 0 and contributes nothing to planTotal, so
    // zero-weight invariance survives; and both the lean and padded plans derive it
    // from their own planTotal, so parity survives.
    //
    // Capped, because sqrt grows without bound: one surviving note would otherwise be

    //
    // Holding each ring's thickness fixed and letting the spacing fall out of it is the right
    // shape for the problem -- a disc that keeps its size under filtering is what a person
    // wants -- and it does not survive contact with the row count.
    //
    // The two relations are: rows = what this spacing needs (rowsNeeded RISES with spacing,
    // because a wider row holds fewer notes), and spacing = span / (rows - 1). The composite is
    // monotone DECREASING, so plain iteration flips between two extremes rather than settling --
    // measured on the 10k vault, the inner band landed on 31 rows at 4.096 units, a spacing 60x
    // narrower than the counts had been solved against, which drew a lattice of mostly-empty
    // rows (spread 112 against 0 for a clean band). Damping with the geometric mean converges,
    // and converges to a DEGENERATE point: as the spacing narrows the capacity per row grows
    // without bound, one row suffices, and that drives the spacing back to the cap. Measured
    // there: 18 rows at 0.313 units, spread 164.
    //
    // Fixing the spacing and NOT re-deriving the count holds the span exactly and is the same
    // failure by another route: the counts then belong to a spacing nobody drew.
    //
    // What would work is not an iteration at all. A band of thickness T over an angular span A
    // at radius r has a known area, and a square lattice of pitch s holds area/s^2 notes -- so
    // s and rows = T/s come out of one division, consistent by construction, with the count
    // never solved against a spacing it will not be drawn with. That is a rewrite of rowsNeeded
    // rather than a wrapper around it, so it is left for its own pass rather than bolted on at
    // the end of this one. The per-band density solve below is what ships: it stops the two
    // rings converging, which was the reported bug, and leaves the rim moving under heavy
    // filtering, which is measured in .ai-context/changelog-detail.md.
    // FILL THE BOX. A wedge is a box in polar coordinates -- an inner radius, an outer radius,
    // and two edges running out to the seams -- and the job is to fill it as evenly as the note
    // count allows. Everything reported this session was one consequence of not doing that:
    // holes where a cell held arc in rows it had no notes for, interior steps wider than the
    // boundary gaps beside them, dots undersized because they are drawn against the radial
    // pitch while sitting at a wider tangential step, and quantisation that always fell hardest
    // on the innermost row because it has the shortest arc.
    //
    // rowsNeeded answers the wrong question. It asks how many rows of a GIVEN spacing it takes
    // to hold n notes -- so it is solved per cell, against a spacing that came from somewhere
    // else, and its answer is always at LEAST enough, which means always a bit too much. The
    // band then ends up deeper than its notes can fill: measured on this vault at a 98-note
    // range, the outer band had capacity for about 90 notes over 3 rows and held 57, so its
    // arcs came out 1.58x wider than one pitch and its tangential step was 626 units against a
    // 396 pitch. Exactly the ratio the dots were missing.
    //
    // A band of thickness T at mean radius R has area 2*pi*R*T, and a square lattice of pitch s
    // holds area/s^2 notes. So s = sqrt(area/n) and rows = T/s come out of ONE division,
    // consistent with each other by construction -- no iteration, and no count solved against a
    // spacing it will not be drawn with. Earlier attempts to reach this by feeding a row count
    // back into a spacing solve did not converge: the composite is monotone decreasing, so plain
    // iteration flips between extremes and damping converges to a degenerate point. This is why
    // it had to be a rewrite rather than a wrapper.
    //
    // Every cell then takes the BAND's row count, not its own. With arc allocated in proportion
    // to note count, equal depth makes every cell equally full, which is what puts one step on
    // the whole ring. Low-count folders are the exception and are handled before this: a folder

    // and scale SP until maxR lands on the lock. It was written, and it MADE THINGS
    // WORSE: pitch * sqrt(shown) spread 1.10x -> 1.15x, because the loop drove SP back
    // to 1 in almost every state and undid the whole change.
    //
    // The reason is worth keeping, because it contradicts what this was built on.
    // Filtering a vault BARELY MOVES THE DISC'S RADIUS: maxR is the max over cells, and
    // hiding some folders leaves the deepest survivor holding all of its own notes, so
    // it still reaches the rim. Measured on the baseline, reach was 1.000 with 481, 465
    // and 382 of 503 notes showing -- there was no empty margin to reclaim at all. What
    // filtering does is make the disc SPARSER inside a radius that hardly changes.
    //
    // And that radius is quantised in whole rows. The outermost row already sits flush
    // against the box, so any spreading at all pushes it a full row out: 2.3% more
    // spacing bought 7% more radius. There is no SP between "no change" and "one row
    // over", which is exactly why a loop targeting the lock can only pick SP = 1.
    //
    // So the overshoot is accepted and handled where it belongs -- in the camera, which
    // is the thing that decides how much of the box is on screen. See fitRatio().
    // Rows sit SP apart in every cell -- spacing is never rescaled per cell, which
    // is what keeps density uniform. Each cell's first row is at its band's inner
    // edge, so columns grow outward and a cell ends where its notes run out.
    // Lay a cell's notes out on a grid of exactly `rows` rows. Position is a
    // continuous function of how far through the cell's weight a note sits: s
    // slides smoothly, the row changes only where s crosses a row boundary, and
    // the serpentine keeps u continuous across that boundary (an even row ends at
    // u = 1 and the next row starts at 1 and runs back down).
    // Where a note sits, as ONE continuous formula. Capacity grows linearly with
    // radius, so the cumulative capacity up to a continuous row x is proportional
    // to base*x + SP*x^2/2. Inverting that turns "how far through this cell's
    // weight am I" straight into a row coordinate, with no binning step anywhere.
    //
    // This replaced blending two adjacent integer grids. That blend was the last
    // source of jumps: a note's row differs by up to one between the two grids,
    // and the serpentine parity can differ with it, so u could swing from one end
    // of the wedge to the other -- measured at 1996 units in a frame. Here the row
    // count may be fractional and the coordinate simply slides: the row ticks when
    // the coordinate crosses a boundary, and the triangle wave keeps u continuous
    // across that tick (an even row runs 0 -> 1, the next runs 1 -> 0).

     * per-cell count, with `|| c.rows` behind it, and those are two different quantities:
     *

     * rowsAt returns 0 for a cell in neither endpoint plan ("cell knows best"), and the fallback

     * silently switched definition mid-animation. A cell's key carries its split state, so a
     * group whose split differs between the endpoint plans and the live frame has no matching
     * key and takes exactly that path. Measured on the intro, band depth walked 1 -> 1.3 and
     * then jumped to 4, above BOTH endpoints, before settling back to 3. A depth that overshoots
     * its destination and returns is a disc that swells and re-packs mid-animation, and it feeds
     * the seam falloff and the split gate while it does it.
     *
     * The cascade hands in the walk between the two ENDPOINT depths instead -- each of which is
     * a resting area solve -- so the quantity is the same one throughout, is bounded by its own
     * endpoints, and cannot step.

  //     other, which is exactly how the ring came to change size after the animation
  //     had finished.

    // literally-empty runs, which undersold the actual ask: a year holding a note or two in
    // most months (so nothing in it ever reads as "empty") still summed to a full year of
    // real-time weight, competing evenly against a year an order of magnitude busier just
    // because both have "every month populated". Measured on the vault this shipped
    // against: 2023 (21 notes, spread thin enough to touch nearly every month) drew WIDER
    // than 2026 (399 notes, the vault's busiest year by far) under that scheme, because 2026
    // is only partway through its own calendar year and 2023 is not.

    // Two levels, both against the SAME percentile-with-floor shape `nRef` above already
    // uses for bar height -- proven on this file already rather than invented fresh:
    //
    // YEAR gets a width between YEAR_FLOOR_MS (about one month) and YEAR_CEIL_MS (about one
    // real year) based on its own note count against `yearRef`, the p90-with-floor
    // reference over every year's count -- so a handful of outlier years cannot both crowd
    // every other year to nothing AND still keep climbing themselves; the ceiling is what
    // makes "compact" years equidistant in the first place; a year at or past yearRef reads
    // as fully wide.
    //
    // WITHIN a year, every one of its months gets an EQUAL share of the year's own weight --
    // deliberately not weighted by the month's own note count. Tried the finer-grained
    // version first (each month's own share of its year, floored so a note-less month
    // still got a sliver) and it read as noise: month-to-month note counts inside one year
    // are not a signal worth spending width on, and equal months make every year's own
    // internal month-tick spacing predictable, which the density weighting between YEARS
    // does not need help from.
    //
    // NOT A NO-OP ON AN EVEN-BY-TIME VAULT ANY MORE. The earlier month-real-duration scheme
    // reduced exactly to the linear formula whenever no month was literally empty; this one
    // does not, because it weighs a YEAR by its content rather than by its calendar length
    // even when every month in it has something -- two years of equal length but unequal

  /* ------------------------------------------------------------ node sizes */

  // Node sizes are SCREEN pixels and are fixed at graph build; the disc's pixel
  // radius is not, because the pinned bbox is mapped to the stage, so a shorter
  // window draws a smaller disc with the same size dots. The NODE_MAX cap of 11 was
  // tuned against a measured ~28px row pitch on a 1068x1270 stage -- and on a 1080p
  // screen the stage is barely 720px tall, where the same disc packs its rows 22.6px
  // apart. Measured there: 3 touching pairs, worst overlap 9.8px. The cap was doing
  // its job; the thing it was calibrated against had moved.
  //
  // So the sizes are scaled by the pitch actually on screen, which restores the
  // tuned radius-to-pitch relationship at any window size. Capped at 1 so a large
  // screen is untouched (measured 30.3px there, i.e. already above the reference),
  // and floored so dots cannot vanish. Zooming in raises the pitch and returns the
  // scale to 1, which is the right behaviour: zoom is how you get detail back.
  // A FLOOR ON THE SCALE IS A FLOOR ON OVERLAP, and that is what it turned into.
  //
  // Scaling every size by pitch/REF_PITCH keeps the tuned radius-to-pitch relationship, so
  // dots never outgrow the lattice -- but only while the scale is allowed to fall. The floor
  // was there so dots could not vanish, and it was set against vaults whose rows land 22-30px
  // apart. A 10,000-note disc fitted to the stage puts its rows 4.5px apart, where the honest
  // scale is 0.16 and the floor holds it at 0.45 -- so dots draw 2.8x too big for the lattice.
  // Measured there: the biggest dot 175 units of RADIUS against a 160-unit row pitch, 349
  // across, and the MEDIAN dot 192 across. At those sizes overlap is not a tuning problem,
  // it is arithmetic, and it was also what made wedges interleave along their boundaries.
  //
  // So the two ends are handled separately, because they want opposite things. The BIGGEST dot
  // is capped at a fraction of the pitch, which is the relationship that has to hold or notes
  // collide. The SMALLEST is floored in pixels, which is the one that has to hold or notes
  // disappear. In between it is linear, so the degree ordering survives wherever there is room
  // to show it -- and where there is not, the range simply flattens rather than overflowing.
  //
  // DOT_OF_PITCH is 11/28: the cap and reference pitch that were already tuned together, now
  // expressed as the ratio they always were. At the reference pitch this reproduces today's
  // sizes exactly; below it, it keeps doing what the multiplier was meant to.
  var REF_PITCH = 28;
  // NO FLOOR AND NO CEILING ON A MULTIPLIER, because the multiplier is gone. github#13

  // nearly tripled -- but a clamp at either end is a knee, and a knee is what dots growing as
  // you zoom in and then shrinking again actually is. Measured across a 21x zoom, diameter
  // over pitch: 0.786 flat below the old knee, then 0.55, 0.367, 0.092 above it.
  //
  // Both ends are now separate numbers with separate jobs, and neither is a clamp on the
  // other: the biggest dot is a fraction of the pitch (or notes collide), the smallest is a
  // floor in PIXELS (or notes vanish), and the range between them is linear. The room a
  // filtered disc gains is picked up per note by dotFit, which measures it rather than
  // inferring it from a ratio of counts.

  // where two of them are most of the space between their neighbours.
  // Up from 1.6, which was set when a filtered band's dots became blobs -- and most of that
  // was the inner band wearing the OUTER band's ramp, since there was only one. With a ramp per
  // band, a dot can follow its own lattice all the way to the spacing cap, which is what keeps
  // the proportion the design is stated in. Measured before: a 96-of-454 range spread the outer
  // pitch to 2.5 while the cap held dots at 1.6, so diameter over step came out 0.49 at the
  // largest dot against a design of 0.786 -- 0.786 * (1.6 / 2.5) exactly. Reported as gaps
  // between the seam and the edge notes, which is what a sparse ring of undersized dots is.

  // diameter holding few notes spreads TANGENTIALLY without limit while its radial pitch is
  // capped at DENSITY_MAX. Measured on a 22-of-454 range: pitch 416 units, step 1046 -- 2.5x --
  // so a 1.6 ceiling drew dots at diameter/step 0.26 against a design of 0.786, and the ring

    // the knee the dots tracked the lattice; above it they froze at 11px while the lattice kept
    // growing, so they read as swelling and then dwindling. Measured, diameter over pitch:

   * THE INTRO IS THE RIGHT-HAND SCRUBBER, TRAVELLING.
   *
   * Growing the vault from its first note to now and dragging the range end from one end of
   * the strip to the other are the same statement about the same history, and the page used to
   * make it twice in two different units: the disc revealed notes by RANK while the sidebar's
   * slider counted them, and the ribbon -- the control that actually draws the history -- sat
   * still through all of it. With the slider gone the animation had nothing left to say what
   * it was doing.
   *
   * SO THE PROGRESS FRACTION IS TURNED INTO A DATE THROUGH THE RANK, not through the span.
   * That is the whole of why it stays in sync. Interpolating dateSpan.lo -> dateSpan.hi
   * linearly would put the handle at 2020 while the disc was already showing every note from
   * 2026, because the reveal is ordered by rank and this vault is not spread evenly in time:
   * measured, 409 of 442 notes fall in the last three months against a handful back to 2015.
   * Reading tlDateMs at rank `pr * tlMax` makes the handle's position mean exactly "everything
   * left of here is on screen", which is the same thing it means when a hand is on it.
   *
   * The consequence is honest and worth naming: the handle crawls through the empty years and
   * sprints across the last months. That is the shape of the vault, and the bars underneath it
   * are drawing the same shape.
   *
   * THE TOOLTIP COMES TOO, because it is what a real drag shows -- the strip has no numeric
   * readout of its own, and the date under the handle is what the deleted sidebar readout was
   * for. Same helper, same position, so the intro and the gesture look alike down to the label.

   * silently zooming to refill the viewport every frame of every cascade. That is right

   * So the ratio is scaled by how much of the locked extent the disc currently uses. At full
   * vault that is 1 and this is exactly the old constant; with the outer ring toggled away it
   * closes in on what is left. The box does the not-moving and the camera does the zooming,
   * which keeps the two jobs apart -- renormalising the box per frame is what moved the ring
   * centre 13px and zoomed 8.2% with the camera provably untouched.
   *
   * Measured on the live radius rather than the plan's: a plan is what the layout intends and
   * this question is about what is on screen, which after a cascade are the same thing and

  // A CEILING, not the answer: heatGeom picks the count that fills the band at a legible cell
  // and clamps to this. Three years, because past that the window stops being "recently" and
  // the ribbon below is the instrument for picking a year.
  // A ROLLING YEAR. It was raised to three so a wide band could be filled, and filling it is
  // not worth the trade: the window is what "notes added" is about, and a year is the span a

  // carried by how finely the square is divided -- one note is a solid block, 180 are
  // about a pixel each -- so a busy day reads as fine-grained and mixed and a quiet one
  // as a flat slab of a single folder's colour.
  //
  // Two earlier versions are worth knowing about, because both were measured to fail.
  //
  // AVERAGING the day's colours failed in both directions. Mixing many hues in OKLab
  // collapses toward grey, so the busiest day -- being also the most mixed -- came out
  // DULLER than a quiet single-colour day: 180 notes at OKLab L=0.713 against L=0.781
  // for a 13-note day. And with five quantile levels the count channel was flat at the

  // bottom (1-note days reached L=0.47 while 2-note days started at 0.45).

  // note to the full 13px at 180 -- but a grid of squares that are mostly not touching

  // already reports exactly. Full squares read as a surface. The cost is real and worth

  // A scripted walkthrough, for watching and for recording. `?demo` in the URL arms it.

  // THE PAGE DOES NOT PERFORM THE INPUT. It publishes a storyboard and answers two
  // questions about itself -- where is that control, and are you still moving -- and a
  // driver outside the browser does the clicking through Chrome's DevTools protocol
  // (`Input.dispatchMouseEvent`). See `scripts/demo.mjs`.
  //
  // Why not just call el.click() from in here, which is far less machinery: because
  // that is not what a user does, and the difference is exactly the part worth
  // demonstrating. A dispatched click skips hit-testing entirely -- it fires on an
  // element that is covered by something else, or scrolled out of view, or 0x0 -- so an
  // in-page demo keeps passing after the button it aims at has become unclickable. CDP
  // input goes in at the top of the same pipeline a mouse does: it hit-tests, it raises
  // the hover states the page draws for real, and it fails when a real click would.
  //
  // An earlier cut drew its own SVG arrow and dispatched synthetic MouseEvents to move
  // it. Removed. Besides the hit-testing hole, the mark fought the physical mouse:
  // measured, it finished a run at (0, 847) instead of on the button it had just
  // clicked at (42, 650), because clicking the eye rebuilds the legend's DOM and Chrome
  // then re-dispatches a mousemove at the REAL cursor -- so a mouse parked anywhere
  // teleported the mark on every rebuild.

   * unreachable -- on a ten-year vault that is nine years with nothing to point at. This is
   * the axis that reaches them, and the two ends of the brush are the filter.
   *
   * WHY THE AXIS IS LINEAR IN TIME, which is the one real decision here. Measured on the
   * author's vault: 452 notes over 11.4 years, 389 of them in 2026, and a whole year (2021)
   * holding none. A time axis therefore spends most of its width on very little -- the
   * sidebar's timeline slider dodges exactly this by being linear in note count instead.
   *
   * It is kept anyway, because the two are not the same instrument. A slider is for
   * *setting* a value and wants its travel spent evenly. This is for *finding* one, and what
   * makes a date findable is that it sits where you expect on a calendar: 2019 is at 2019,
   * the burst is visibly a burst, and the year with nothing in it is visibly empty. Spending
   * the width proportionally to notes would put 2021 and 2026 side by side at the same size
   * and lose all three of those facts. Two other concepts were built -- a year rail beside
   * the band, and twin rank-linear sliders -- and this is the one that survived.
   *
   * The bars are sqrt-scaled for the same reason the disc's node sizes are: one month here
   * holds 631 notes and most hold under 40, so a linear height is one bar and a flat line.

  /**
   * ORDERED BY IMPACT, not by where the code lives.
   *
   * The storyboard used to run roughly in the order the features were built: the intro, a
   * couple of hovers, then the legend, the colour picker, the camera, and the date ribbon
   * LAST. That is backwards for a recording. A README hero is watched for a few seconds
   * before the reader decides whether to keep watching, so the two things this page does
   * that nothing else does -- the vault growing out of nothing, and a note lifting out of
   * the disc with its links lit -- have to be in those seconds. The colour picker, which is
   * a preference panel, was landing before the timeline, which is the point of the tool.
   *
   * The acts now run: the vault growing, one note, pinning a note, the timeline, the
   * heatmap, folders, subfolders, subfolder colours, the camera, colours. Roughly
   * descending in "would this make someone stop scrolling", with two exceptions that
   * are structural rather than editorial:
   *
   *   * FOLDERS BEFORE SUBFOLDERS, because the subfolder rows do not exist until a twisty
   *     has been clicked, and `only` must run while 03 is folded -- soloing while it is
   *     open deletes its rows and pulls everything below them up by 97px, so the pointer
   *     ends up over a row three below the one it clicked. That cost a take.
   *   * COLOURS LAST, because colour is a preference and every earlier act should land
   *     on the disc's own palette, not one an earlier take happened to leave behind.
   *
   * COLOURS IS EXCLUDED FROM THE FULL RUN -- see FULL_RUN_EXCLUDES, just below this
   * function. It still exists here and still plays on its own via `demoAct("colours")`,
   * for docs/features/colours.md's own clip: right-clicking a top-level folder's row for
   * its colour picker. But subfoldercolor already puts that same right-click menu on
   * camera, one level down, and running the identical gesture twice in the same take
   * added length without showing the reader anything new.
   *
   * PIN IS EARLY ON PURPOSE, not tucked in near the end where it used to sit. It is the
   * one act that puts a note somewhere other than its lattice seat, and it earns being
   * seen before the reader has settled into "this is a filter-and-browse tool". The
   * cost is real and accepted: it leaves up to three notes sitting in the hub for
   * every act after it, so a re-record of the full storyboard shows a filled hub in
   * the timeline, heatmap, folders, subfolders and camera acts too. That is not a bug
   * to route around -- the hub is not a special case to cut away from, it is what the
   * disc looks like once you have used it.
   *
   * Beats are DATA, so reordering is reordering -- the driver holds no state between them.
   * What it is NOT free of is the ordering constraints above and the ones each act names.
   *
   * Every beat below also carries an `act:` tag naming which of these ten it belongs to
   * -- `demoAct(name)`, just after this function, plays one act on its own instead of the
   * whole thing, for the per-feature clips in docs/features.md. `demoFullStoryboard()`,
   * also just below, is the same ten with `colours` filtered back out again for the full
   * run.

    // the time the first frame lands. Measured on a take: one second in, the disc was
    // already at 250 of 449 notes.

    // So under ?demo the page comes up AT REST and the storyboard replays the intro
    // itself, through the Refresh button, once the recording is rolling.
    // timelineFrame(true) is the resting full disc: `until` is null by default, so every
    // note is present and the layout is derived once, with no animation.

    // playTimeline() reveals notes one at a time over about five seconds, and the disc is
    // legitimately sparse while it does -- rows hold a fraction of their notes, so the room
    // those rows report is genuinely wide and the channels drawn from it are genuinely wide.
    // That is what an unfinished intro looks like, and it is fine, because it finishes.

    // frame a second there, and the stall watchdog that would force the cascade to complete is
    // itself driven by rAF, so it never fires either. The tab is left parked on an early frame
    // for as long as it stays hidden -- and switching to it does not restart anything, so it
    // just sits there. Reported as "load three vaults and only the visible one renders
    // correctly", with gaps several times the row spacing in the other two.
