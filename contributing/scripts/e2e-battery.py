"""Corpus battery: controlled edge-dump pairs over fresh clones at pinned commits.

Enforces the measurement protocol invariants that prose could not:
  - fixture pristineness (clean checkout before cloning from it)
  - clone integrity (populated working tree; poisoned partial clones rejected)
  - pin verification (corpus HEAD equals the requested pin)
  - fresh workspace per leg (never reused; stale indexed_paths double-index)
  - verified semantic toggle (written to settings.toml, then read back AND
    confirmed against the index log line)
  - sorted dumps, optional two-run determinism; scatter corpora declare
    --scatter-exclude patterns: the post-exclusion union is the corpus's
    reproducible anchor, and scatter rows matching no pattern fail the run
  - every run's dumps, diffs, and printed summary are preserved under
    .logs/battery/<date>-<label>/ (gitignored; survives session cleanup,
    not `git clean -x`)
  - diff mechanics (comm order encapsulated; dropped/gained labeled)
  - incremental lane parity (--incremental N): the fresh dump is the oracle;
    re-indexing touched files must not change the edge set. Without this leg
    the battery only ever measured fresh indexes, and an 8.8% inbound-edge
    loss on the incremental lane survived every run.
  - touch shape (--touch-shape, default prepend): the touch SHIFTS ranges, so
    line-sensitive identity paths are exercised. An append-only touch reported
    parity on three corpora while a prepend still dropped edges.
  - relocation shapes (--touch-shape rename | rename-edit | delete):
    rename moves the target files in place (stem_renamed, hash-paired at
    discovery); rename-edit moves them AND appends one newline so no pair
    forms (unpaired deleted-plus-new); delete removes them outright. In
    every shape caller invalidation re-resolves the files owning inbound
    edges. The oracle is a FRESH index of the mutated tree, not the
    pre-mutation dump. Dropped rows AND gained rows both fail the leg:
    recall loss and over-retention are both parity breaks.
  - binary identity: each leg records the commit its index was stamped with
    and two legs may not share one. `--version` does not separate builds
    between releases, so a pre/post pair over one binary otherwise diffs it
    against itself and reports a confident empty result.

Usage:
  e2e-battery.py run  --binary PATH --label NAME --dump PATH \
                      --corpus NAME=FIXTURE_PATH@PIN [...] \
                      --out DIR [--runs N] [--semantic on|off] [--incremental N]
  e2e-battery.py diff --out DIR --corpus NAME --old LABEL --new LABEL

Pins are REQUIRED per corpus (numbers rot; the caller states them).
No cargo invocations here: binaries are built by the caller.
