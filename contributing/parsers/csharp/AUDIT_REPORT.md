# C# Parser Coverage Report

## Summary
- Key nodes: 31/32 (96%)
- Symbol kinds extracted: 9

> **Note:** Key nodes are symbol-producing constructs (classes, methods, properties).

## Legend

- ✅ **implemented**: Node type is recognized and handled by the parser
- ⚠️ **gap**: Node type exists in the grammar but not handled by parser (needs implementation)
- ❌ **not found**: Node type not present in the example file (may need better examples)

## Recommended Actions

### Priority 2: Missing Examples
These nodes aren't in the comprehensive example. Consider:

- `file_scoped_namespace_declaration`: Add example to comprehensive.cs or verify node name
