## Legend

- ✅ **implemented**: Node type is recognized and handled by the parser
- ⚠️ **gap**: Node type exists in the grammar but not handled by parser (needs implementation)
- ❌ **not found**: Node type not present in the example file (may need better examples)

## Recommended Actions

✨ **Excellent coverage!** All key nodes are implemented.
