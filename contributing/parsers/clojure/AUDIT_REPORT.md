# Clojure Parser Symbol Extraction Coverage Report

## Summary
- Key nodes: 15/15 (100%)
- Symbol kinds extracted: 7

> **Note:** Key nodes are symbol-producing constructs (lists containing def forms).

## Legend

- ✅ **implemented**: Node type is recognized and handled by the parser
- ⚠️ **gap**: Node type exists in the grammar but not handled by parser (needs implementation)
- ❌ **not found**: Node type not present in the example file (may need better examples)

## Recommended Actions

✨ **Excellent coverage!** All key nodes are implemented.
