//! Per-tree MCP serve discovery record.
//!
//! When an HTTP MCP server starts for a project tree, it writes a small
//! `.codanna/serve.json` record `{pid, port}` so other tools (e.g. the CLI
//! proxy) can discover a running server without guessing ports. The record
//! is written atomically (temp file + rename) and removed on graceful
//! shutdown. On Unix, permissions are tightened to mode 0600 as a
//! best-effort privacy measure before the file is made visible; this
//! tightening does not apply on non-Unix platforms.
