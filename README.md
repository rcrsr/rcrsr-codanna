**Local code intelligence MCP server and CLI for AI coding agents.**

*X-ray vision for your agent.*

</div>

Codanna is a local code intelligence and semantic code search MCP server for AI coding agents. One MCP call returns symbol context, call graph, and impact analysis, pre-correlated — the grep-and-read loop your agent runs today, collapsed into a single response it can act on.

It indexes your repository on disk and serves symbol search, semantic search, call graphs, dependency tracking, document RAG, and impact analysis to Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, Gemini, and any MCP-compatible client — as a persistent MCP server for session-long work, or a one-shot CLI for instant answers when LSP is too slow. Written in Rust. 15 languages. No source code leaves your machine.

## Two operational modes

Codanna's MCP toolset is reachable two ways. Same tools, same surface — pick the mode that fits the workflow.

**Persistent MCP server** — for session-long agent workflows.

```bash
codanna serve                # stdio
codanna serve --http         # HTTP
codanna serve --https        # HTTPS
```

**One-shot CLI** — for slash-commands, bash hooks, scripts, CI. No daemon required.

```bash
codanna mcp find_symbol name:"my_function"
codanna mcp analyze_impact symbol_name:"my_function"
codanna mcp semantic_search_with_context query:"recursively extract function calls"
```

`codanna mcp semantic_search_with_context` is the headline command: it returns N semantic matches, and for each match the symbol identity, signature, docstring, callees, callers, and recursive impact analysis — five MCP tools fused into one query.

The one-shot CLI is also what makes codanna skill-friendly: an Agent Skill can wrap `codanna mcp` commands directly in Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, Gemini, or any harness that runs shell commands — no MCP plumbing required.

## What one call returns

The headline command, run against codanna's own source tree. One call, and the agent has the symbol, its documentation, signature, callees with exact call sites, callers, and blast radius:

```text
$ codanna mcp semantic_search_with_context query:"recursively extract function calls" limit:1

Found 1 results for query: 'recursively extract function calls'

1. extract_calls_recursive - Method at src/parsing/cpp/parser.rs:1002-1047 [symbol_id:1477]
   Similarity Score: 0.833
   Documentation:
     Recursively extract function calls with context tracking
   Signature: fn extract_calls_recursive<'a>(
        node: Node,
        code: &'a str,
        current_function: Option<&'a str>,
        calls: &mut Vec<(&'a str, &'a str, Range)>,
    )

   extract_calls_recursive calls 3 function(s):
     -> Method extract_calls_recursive at src/parsing/cpp/parser.rs:1002 [symbol_id:1477] (called at src/parsing/cpp/parser.rs:1045)
     -> Method function_name_at_def at src/parsing/cpp/parser.rs:377 [symbol_id:1451] (called at src/parsing/cpp/parser.rs:1008)
     -> Method new at src/types/mod.rs:112 [symbol_id:7388] (called at src/parsing/cpp/parser.rs:1028)

   2 function(s) call extract_calls_recursive:
     <- Method extract_calls_recursive at src/parsing/cpp/parser.rs:1045 [symbol_id:1477]
     <- Method find_calls at src/parsing/cpp/parser.rs:885 [symbol_id:1467]

   Changing extract_calls_recursive would impact 1 symbol(s) (max depth: 2):

     methods (1):
       - find_calls [symbol_id:1467]

Guidance: Found one match with full context. Review the relationships to understand how this fits into the codebase.
```

Every result carries `file:line` coordinates the agent can open directly, `symbol_id`s it can reuse to disambiguate name collisions, and a guidance hint it can chain on. Add `--json` for the structured envelope.

## Local-first

Codanna runs on your machine. The repository index lives on disk under `.codanna/`. The embedding model downloads once on first use, then runs locally. No source code, symbols, or queries are sent to a remote API by default. Remote OpenAI-compatible embeddings are opt-in: `remote_url` under `[semantic_search]` in `settings.toml`, or `CODANNA_EMBED_*` environment variables; the API key is environment-only.

## Fork Notice

This is **rcrsr-codanna**, a fork of [`bartolli/codanna`](https://github.com/bartolli/codanna). It carries fork-private additions (including `serve --proxy` mode) and reports its build with a `+rcrsr.N` suffix. See **[RCRSR-README.md](RCRSR-README.md)** for the list of changes and the versioning convention.

## Quick Start

### Install (macOS, Linux, WSL)

```bash
curl -fsSL --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://install.codanna.sh | sh
```

### Or via Homebrew

```bash
brew install codanna
```

### Or via Nix

```bash
nix run github:bartolli/codanna
```

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bartolli/codanna/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

See [Installation Guide](https://docs.codanna.sh/installation) for Cargo and other options.

### Initialize and index

```bash
codanna init
codanna index src
```

### Search code

```bash
codanna mcp semantic_search_with_context query:"where do we handle errors" limit:3
```

### Search documentation (RAG)

```bash
codanna documents add-collection docs ./docs
codanna documents index
codanna mcp search_documents query:"authentication flow"
```

Read-only tools, including `search_documents`, are safe to call concurrently
from multiple clients in every `serve` mode: `search_documents` only takes a
brief exclusive lock to check document collections for changes, then releases
it before searching. A force reindex takes a similarly brief write lock around
the walk, so readers may transiently observe a repopulating index while it's
in flight — see RCRSR-README.md's "Concurrency contract" section for the full
picture.

## What It Does

Your AI assistant gains structured knowledge of your code:

- **"Where's this function called?"** - Instant call graph, not grep results
- **"Find authentication logic"** - Semantic search matches intent, not just keywords
- **"What breaks if I change this?"** - Full dependency analysis across files

The difference: Codanna understands code structure. It knows `parseConfig` is a function that calls `validateSchema`, not just a string match.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **[Semantic Search](https://docs.codanna.sh/features/semantic-search)** | Natural language queries against code and documentation. Finds functions by what they do, not just their names. |
| **[Relationship Tracking](https://docs.codanna.sh/features/relationships)** | Call graphs, implementations, and dependencies. Trace how code connects across files. |
| **[Document Search](https://docs.codanna.sh/features/document-search)** | Index markdown and text files for RAG workflows. Query project docs alongside code. |
| **[MCP Protocol](https://docs.codanna.sh/reference/mcp-quick)** | Native integration with Claude, Gemini, Codex, and other AI assistants. |
| **[Profiles](https://docs.codanna.sh/features/collaboration)** | Package hooks, commands, and agents for different project types. |

**Performance:** parser throughput 76,000-249,000 symbols/second depending on language; warm-server lookups under 10 ms (0.3 ms exact, ~3 ms semantic). Parsing is the fast layer; embedding generation during indexing takes longer and scales with your cores. Measured numbers, machine spec, and reproduction commands: [Benchmarks](https://docs.codanna.sh/reference/benchmarks).

**Languages:** Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Kotlin, Go, PHP, C, C++, C#, Clojure, Lua, Swift, GDScript.

## Integration

Add codanna to any MCP-compatible client. Project-scoped `.mcp.json` (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codanna": {
      "command": "codanna",
      "args": ["--config", ".codanna/settings.toml", "serve", "--watch"]
    }
  }
}
```

`--watch` keeps the index hot as files change. Transports: stdio, HTTP, HTTPS. See [Integration Guides](https://docs.codanna.sh/reference/mcp-quick) for Claude Desktop, Gemini, Codex, and network setups.

## Requirements

- ~150MB for embedding model (downloaded on first use)
- **Build from source:** Rust 1.85+, Linux needs `pkg-config libssl-dev`
- Windows support is experimental
